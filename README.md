The **Lido on Ethereum Liquid Staking Protocol** allows their users to earn staking rewards on the Beacon chain without locking ether or maintaining staking infrastructure.

Users can deposit ether to the Lido smart contract and receive stETH tokens in return. The smart contract then stakes tokens with the DAO-picked node operators. Users' deposited funds are pooled by the DAO, and node operators never have direct access to the users' assets.

Unlike staked ether, the stETH token is free from the limitations associated with a lack of liquidity, and can be transferred at any time. The stETH token balance corresponds to the amount of ether that the holder could request to withdraw.

**NB:** It's advised to read [Documentation](https://docs.lido.fi/) before getting started with this repo.

## Lido DAO

The [Lido DAO](https://docs.lido.fi/lido-dao) is a Decentralized Autonomous Organization that manages the liquid staking protocol by deciding on key parameters (e.g., setting fees, assigning node operators and oracles, performing upgrades, etc.) through the voting power of governance token (LDO) holders.

The Lido DAO charges service fees that support infrastructure maintenance, research, development, protocol upgrades, and potential loss coverage.

The Lido DAO was built using the [Aragon DAO]((https://aragon.org/dao)) framework.

## Protocol levers

A full list of protocol levers that are controllable by the Aragon DAO can be found [here](https://docs.lido.fi/guides/protocol-levers/).

## Contracts

For the contracts description see <https://docs.lido.fi/> contracts section.

## Deployments

For the protocol contracts addresses see <https://docs.lido.fi/deployed-contracts/>

## Development

### Requirements

* shell - bash or zsh
* find
* sed
* jq
* curl
* cut
* node.js v18
* (optional) Lerna
* (optional) Foundry

### Installing Aragon & other deps

Installation is local and doesn't require root privileges.

If you have `yarn` installed globally:

```bash
yarn
```

otherwise:

```bash
npx yarn
```

### Build & test

Run unit tests:

```bash
yarn test
```

Run unit tests and report gas used by each Solidity function:

```bash
yarn test:gas
```

Generate unit test coverage report:

```bash
yarn test:coverage
```

Test coverage is reported to `coverage.json` and `coverage/index.html` files located
inside each app's folder.

> Keep in mind that the code uses `assert`s to check invariants that should always be kept
unless the code is buggy (in contrast to `require` statements which check pre-conditions),
so full branch coverage will never be reported until
[solidity-coverage#219] is implemented.

[solidity-coverage#219]: https://github.com/sc-forks/solidity-coverage/issues/269

Run fuzzing tests with foundry:

```bash
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
foundryup
forge test
```

## Deploying

To deploy the smart contracts and run the protocol instance either locally or on a new testnet,
please proceed to the following [scratch deploy documentation](/docs/scratch-deploy.md)
